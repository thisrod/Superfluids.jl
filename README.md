# Superfluids

*Solvers for the Gross-Pitaevskiii equation and the Bogoliubov-de
Gennes eigenproblem in Julia.*

## Installation

The package can be installed with the Julia package manager.  From
the Julia REPL, type `]` to enter the Pkg REPL mode and run:

``` pkg> add https://github.com/thisrod/Superfluids.jl.git ```

Or, equivalently, via the `Pkg` API:

```julia julia> import Pkg;
Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/thisrod/Superfluids.jl.git") ```

## Project Aim and Status

This is an early prototype, and the interface is often completely
redesigned.  Use at your own risk.  The current implementation only
supports 2-dimensional order parameters, but they mostly work.

There is a roadmap for future development in the documentation.

## Questions and Contributions

At this stage, questions and feedback should be raised as issues
on this repository.  Pull requests are welcome, also reports of
what other people (try and fail to) do with the package.
